# Create a CloudWatch Alarm

## Introduction

CloudWatch can track metrics of different AWS resources and is able to send notifications or alarms. I chose it to practice to learn how to maake alarms for sensitive processes. 

## Use Case

- Amazon CloudWatch can be configured to send a notification when CPU utilization of an instance is greater than 1%. Or as I used it, to track the traffic to the website created.

## Cloud Research
-  There is no limit to the number of alarms that you can create.
- You can favorite alarms from the Favorites and recents option in the CloudWatch console navigation pane.
- You can test an alarm by setting it to any state using the SetAlarmState API action or the set-alarm-state command in the AWS CLI. This temporary state change lasts only until the next alarm comparison occurs.
