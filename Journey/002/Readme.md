# Host a simple static webpage with S3 and CloudFront

## Introduction

This is for a personal project, I made this to test how it will look when it is done.

The project aims to allow users to search for an item on the Steam market, display the image, price and information about the item. As well as provide a functionality for the user to be reminded when the item has reached a certain price threshold.

## Use Case

S3 can be used to deploy a static website or a website with client-side dynamic functions, it's an easy, practically free way to deplopy a website. Route 53 can be used to give the website a custom dns name. Cloudfront distributes static and dynamic websites through AWS's edge locations to provide low latency and high performance.

## Cloud Research

- I learnt how to use Cloudfront and how to limit a s3 bucket's content to only be accessed by the Cloudfront endpoint.
